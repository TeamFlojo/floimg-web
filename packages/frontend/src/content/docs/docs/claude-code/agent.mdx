title: Image Architect Agent
description: Specialized agent for complex image generation and workflow planning
---

The Image Architect is a specialized agent that handles complex image tasks. It understands image requirements, selects optimal generators, and plans efficient multi-step workflows.

## When to Use the Agent

The Image Architect automatically activates for:

- Complex image tasks requiring multiple steps
- Requests that need generator selection advice
- Multi-image workflows (dashboards, asset sets)
- Tasks requiring optimization decisions

## Capabilities

### Generator Expertise

The agent deeply understands each floimg generator:

| Generator | Best For | Key Parameters |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| OpenAI/DALL-E | Photorealistic images, illustrations, creative scenes | prompt, size, quality |
| QuickChart | Data visualization, charts, graphs | type, data, options |
| Mermaid | Technical diagrams, flowcharts, sequences | code |
| QR | QR codes, barcodes | text, errorCorrectionLevel |
| Screenshot | Webpage captures | url, fullPage, width |
| D3 | Custom data visualizations | render, data |

### Generator Selection

The agent analyzes your request and picks the right tool:

**AI Images (OpenAI)** - Creative, photorealistic, or artistic content
- "a sunset over mountains"
- "product mockup on marble table"
- "illustration of a robot"

**Charts (QuickChart)** - Data visualization
- "bar chart of sales by quarter"
- "pie chart showing market share"
- "line graph of user growth"

**Diagrams (Mermaid)** - Technical/architectural visuals
- "flowchart of user registration"
- "sequence diagram of API calls"
- "entity relationship diagram"

**QR Codes** - Encoded data
- "QR code for website URL"
- "QR with WiFi credentials"

**Screenshots (Playwright)** - Webpage captures
- "screenshot of competitor's landing page"
- "capture the mobile view of our site"

### Workflow Planning

For complex requests, the agent designs optimized pipelines:

1. **Analyze requirements** - What final output is needed?
2. **Decompose into steps** - Generate -> Transform(s) -> Save
3. **Choose optimal generators** - Match capability to need
4. **Plan transforms** - Apply in optimal order (resize last for quality)
5. **Execute efficiently** - Use pipelines for multi-step work

### Transform Knowledge

The agent knows when and how to apply transforms:

| Operation | When to Use | Quality Tips |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| resize | Final sizing | Apply last to preserve quality |
| blur | Privacy, backgrounds | Low sigma (1-3) for subtle |
| sharpen | After resize | Low sigma (0.5-1) |
| addCaption | Branding, context | Use contrast colors |
| roundCorners | UI elements, avatars | Match design system |
| preset | Quick styling | vintage, vibrant, dramatic, soft |

## Example Interactions

### Dashboard Creation

**You**: "Create a dashboard with 3 charts showing our quarterly data"

**Agent approach**:
1. Create three separate chart generations
2. For each: generate with appropriate chart type
3. Optionally resize all to consistent dimensions
4. Report imageIds and paths for each

### Social Media Assets

**You**: "Generate a hero image for our landing page and prepare social versions"

**Agent approach**:
1. Generate high-quality AI image (1792x1024, hd quality)
2. Create pipeline with resize variants:
   - 1200x630 for Open Graph
   - 800x418 for Twitter
   - 1080x1080 for Instagram
3. Save each variant to specified destination

### Branded Documentation

**You**: "Create a technical architecture diagram and add our company watermark"

**Agent approach**:
1. Generate Mermaid diagram with proper code
2. Transform: addText with company name/logo position
3. Save to cloud for documentation

## Agent Behavior

The Image Architect focuses on getting the job done well:

- Asks clarifying questions only when truly needed
- Explains its generator choices briefly
- Reports results with file paths and imageIds
- Offers follow-up options for variations or transforms

### Clarifying Questions

The agent may ask about:

- **Final use case** - Social media? Documentation? Print?
- **Size/format requirements** - Dimensions? File format?
- **Storage destination** - Local? S3? R2?

### Result Reporting

After completing a task, the agent reports:

- What was created
- Where it's saved (path or URL)
- ImageId for follow-up operations
- Options for additional transforms

## Triggering the Agent

The agent activates automatically for complex tasks. You can also invoke it directly by describing complex image needs:

```
I need to create a data visualization dashboard with:
- A bar chart of monthly sales
- A pie chart of product categories
- All charts should be 800x600 and saved to ./charts/
```

The agent will plan and execute the entire workflow.
