description: Generate images directly from Claude Code with the FloImg plugin
---

The floimg Claude Code plugin brings powerful image generation directly into your Claude Code workflow. Generate charts, diagrams, QR codes, screenshots, and AI images without leaving your terminal.

## Quick Start

Install the plugin and simple commands work immediately:

```bash
npm install -g @teamflojo/floimg-claude
```

Then try:

```
/floimg:qr https://floimg.com
/floimg:chart bar chart with Q1: 100, Q2: 150, Q3: 200
```

**That's it!** Simple commands use the CLI under the hood - no additional setup required.

## Architecture: CLI Simple, MCP Complex

The plugin uses a hybrid approach for the best experience:

| Command Type | Method | Works Immediately? |
|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| Simple (`/floimg:qr`, `/floimg:chart`, `/floimg:diagram`, `/floimg:screenshot`) | CLI via npx | Yes |
| Complex (`/floimg:image`, `/floimg:workflow`) | MCP | After restart |

**Simple commands** are one-shot operations. They work out of the box via CLI.

**Complex commands** benefit from MCP's session state for iterative refinement ("make it bluer"), multi-step transforms, and referencing previous images by ID. Restart Claude Code once to enable MCP.

## Features

### Slash Commands

Six commands for common image tasks:

| Command | What It Does | Method |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| `/floimg:qr` | Create QR codes | CLI |
| `/floimg:chart` | Data visualizations with QuickChart | CLI |
| `/floimg:diagram` | Mermaid diagrams (flowcharts, sequences) | CLI |
| `/floimg:screenshot` | Capture webpages | CLI |
| `/floimg:image` | Generate any image with transforms | MCP |
| `/floimg:workflow` | Multi-step pipelines | MCP |

### Image Architect Agent

A specialized agent for complex image tasks. It understands your requirements, selects optimal generators, and plans efficient workflows.

### Auto-Discovery Skill

Claude automatically detects image-related tasks and uses floimg when you mention charts, diagrams, QR codes, screenshots, or image generation.

## Usage Examples

### Simple Tasks (Work Immediately)

```
/floimg:qr https://floimg.com
/floimg:chart pie chart: Desktop 60%, Mobile 30%, Tablet 10%
/floimg:diagram user login flow: user -> form -> auth -> dashboard
/floimg:screenshot https://github.com
```

### Complex Workflows (After MCP Enabled)

For multi-step workflows with iteration:

```
/floimg:workflow Create a hero image, resize to 1200x630, add caption, save to S3
```

Or iterate naturally:

```
User: "Create a hero image for my tech blog"
Claude: [generates image]

User: "Make it more vibrant"
Claude: [transforms the same image]

User: "Add our tagline at the bottom"
Claude: [adds caption]
```

Session state enables referencing previous images without file paths.

## Configuration

Set environment variables for optional features:

```bash
# AI image generation (DALL-E)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Cloud storage (S3, R2, Tigris)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

## MCP Setup (For Complex Workflows)

MCP unlocks:
- **Multi-step transforms**: generate → resize → caption → save
- **Iterative refinement**: "make it bluer", "add more contrast"
- **Session state**: reference images by ID, not file paths

After installing the plugin, restart Claude Code once. The MCP server auto-configures.

Or manually add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "floimg": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@teamflojo/floimg", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Claude Code 1.0+
