title: MCP Overview
description: Use FloImg as an AI agent tool
---

FloImg provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI agents generate and manipulate images as part of their workflows.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol that enables AI assistants like Claude to use external tools. With FloImg's MCP server, AI agents can:

- Generate images with AI (DALL-E, Stability, Ollama)
- Create charts, diagrams, and QR codes
- Apply precise transforms (resize, caption, adjust colors)
- Save to local storage or cloud (S3, R2)

## Why FloImg + MCP?

AI agents benefit from composable image pipelines. FloImg lets agents:

| Capability | What It Enables |
|------------|-----------------|
| **AI Generation** | Generate creative images via DALL-E, Stability, or local models |
| **Deterministic Transforms** | Resize to exact dimensions, adjust colors precisely, add captions |
| **Mixed Pipelines** | Generate with AI → transform deterministically → save to cloud |
| **Session State** | Reference previous images by ID for iterative refinement |

The power is in composition: agents can generate creatively, then apply precise transforms—all in one pipeline.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the MCP Server

```bash
npm install -g @teamflojo/floimg-mcp
```

### 2. Configure Your AI Client

Add FloImg to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "floimg": {
      "command": "floimg-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Use with AI

The AI can now use FloImg tools:

> "Create a bar chart showing Q1-Q4 revenue: $12k, $19k, $15k, $25k"

The agent will call the FloImg MCP tool to generate the chart.

## Available Tools

The MCP server exposes these tools to AI agents:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `floimg_generate` | Generate images from parameters |
| `floimg_transform` | Modify existing images |
| `floimg_save` | Save images to storage |
