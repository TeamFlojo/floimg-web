FloImg Studio is a visual drag-and-drop interface for building image generation workflows.

## What is FloImg Studio?

FloImg Studio provides a graphical way to:

- Build image workflows without code
- Preview results in real-time
- Export workflows as JSON for the SDK or CLI
- Share workflows with your team

## Self-Hosted vs Managed

FloImg Studio is **open-source and self-hostable**. Run it on your own infrastructure with your own API keys.

```bash
docker run -p 5100:5100 ghcr.io/teamflojo/floimg-studio
```

*Prefer not to manage infrastructure? A hosted version is available at [studio.floimg.com](https://studio.floimg.com).*

## Quick Start

### Using Docker

```bash
# Pull and run
docker run -p 5100:5100 ghcr.io/teamflojo/floimg-studio

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:5100
```

### From Source

FloImg Studio is part of the floimg monorepo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teamflojo/floimg.git
cd floimg
pnpm install
pnpm dev:studio
```

## The Interface

Connect nodes by dragging from output ports to input ports. Data flows left to right.

### Preview Panel

See real-time previews of each node's output as you build.

## Features

### Real-Time Preview

Every node shows a live preview. Change parameters and see results instantly.

### Export Options

Export your workflow as:
- **JSON** - For the SDK or CLI
- **Code** - TypeScript snippet
